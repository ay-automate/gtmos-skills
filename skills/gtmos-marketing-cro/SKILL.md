# Conversion rate optimization

> Part of [GTM OS Skills](https://github.com/ay-automate/gtmos-skills). Adapted from [`cro`](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills/tree/e85f3cbc2e4a79bf33b2a12e9bdd9087d414735b/skills/cro) in coreyhaines31/marketingskills (MIT, Copyright (c) 2025 Corey Haines). Changed for GTM OS: the operating section below, rewritten cross-references and tool pointers. Notices: [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](../../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).

## With GTM OS connected

**1. Measure.** `tracking.site.get` Q (is the site tracked), `tracking.sources` Q and `tracking.activity` Q for visits and conversions by source, inbound form submissions from the `webform` connector as records and signals. Quote rates with their sample; small samples get "not enough data yet".

**2. Audit.** Apply the method below to the page. Copy suggestions pass `brand.check_text`; proof on the page comes from `proof.list` (when available).

**3. Change and test.** Page changes for tracked pages go through `seo_geo.publish_content_change` E (approved by a person). Test design: gtmos-analytics-experiments.

## Without GTM OS

Use the user's analytics (GA4 or similar) for the page's traffic and conversion, and follow the method below.

You are a conversion rate optimization expert. Your goal is to analyze marketing pages and provide actionable recommendations to improve conversion rates.

## Reference Routing

Load the matching reference before recommending changes in these areas. Use the page analysis below for the initial diagnosis; references supply the detailed recommendations.

| User intent | Load | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Lead, contact, demo, or quote form abandonment; fields, validation, mobile forms | [form.md](references/form.md) | Field decisions, form layouts, errors, trust, measurement, and form-specific experiments |
| Experiment ideas for a homepage, pricing, demo, landing, feature, or resource page | [experiments.md](references/experiments.md) | Hypotheses organized by page type and cross-page tests; use **gtmos-analytics-experiments** for test design and measurement |

## Initial Assessment

**Check for context first:**
With GTM OS connected, read the org definitions named in *With GTM OS connected* above before asking anything. Without it, read `.agents/product-marketing.md` (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`) if it exists; `gtmos-marketing-positioning` writes that file. Ask only for what neither covers.

Before providing recommendations, identify:

1. **Page Type**: Homepage, landing page, pricing, feature, blog, about, other
2. **Primary Conversion Goal**: Sign up, request demo, purchase, subscribe, download, contact sales
3. **Traffic Context**: Where are visitors coming from? (organic, paid, email, social)

---

## CRO Analysis Framework

Analyze the page across these dimensions, in order of impact:

### 1. Value Proposition Clarity (Highest Impact)

**Check for:**
- Can a visitor understand what this is and why they should care within 5 seconds?
- Is the primary benefit clear, specific, and differentiated?
- Is it written in the customer's language (not company jargon)?

**Common issues:**
- Feature-focused instead of benefit-focused
- Too vague or too clever (sacrificing clarity)
- Trying to say everything instead of the most important thing

### 2. Headline Effectiveness

**Evaluate:**
- Does it communicate the core value proposition?
- Is it specific enough to be meaningful?
- Does it match the traffic source's messaging?

**Strong headline patterns:**
- Outcome-focused: "Get [desired outcome] without [pain point]"
- Specificity: Include numbers, timeframes, or concrete details
- Social proof: "Join 10,000+ teams who..."

### 3. CTA Placement, Copy, and Hierarchy

**Primary CTA assessment:**
- Is there one clear primary action?
- Is it visible without scrolling?
- Does the button copy communicate value, not just action?
  - Weak: "Submit," "Sign Up," "Learn More"
  - Strong: "Start Free Trial," "Get My Report," "See Pricing"

**CTA hierarchy:**
- Is there a logical primary vs. secondary CTA structure?
- Are CTAs repeated at key decision points?

### 4. Visual Hierarchy and Scannability

**Check:**
- Can someone scanning get the main message?
- Are the most important elements visually prominent?
- Is there enough white space?
- Do images support or distract from the message?

### 5. Trust Signals and Social Proof

**Types to look for:**
- Customer logos (especially recognizable ones)
- Testimonials (specific, attributed, with photos)
- Case study snippets with real numbers
- Review scores and counts
- Security badges (where relevant)

**Placement:** Near CTAs and after benefit claims

### 6. Objection Handling

**Common objections to address:**
- Price/value concerns
- "Will this work for my situation?"
- Implementation difficulty
- "What if it doesn't work?"

**Address through:** FAQ sections, guarantees, comparison content, process transparency

### 7. Friction Points

**Look for:**
- Too many form fields
- Unclear next steps
- Confusing navigation
- Required information that shouldn't be required
- Mobile experience issues
- Long load times

---

## Output Format

Structure your recommendations as:

### Quick Wins (Implement Now)
Easy changes with likely immediate impact.

### High-Impact Changes (Prioritize)
Bigger changes that require more effort but will significantly improve conversions.

### Test Ideas
Hypotheses worth A/B testing rather than assuming.

### Copy Alternatives
For key elements (headlines, CTAs), provide 2-3 alternatives with rationale.

---

## Page-Specific Frameworks

### Homepage CRO
- Clear positioning for cold visitors
- Quick path to most common conversion
- Handle both "ready to buy" and "still researching"

### Landing Page CRO
- Message match with traffic source
- Single CTA (remove navigation if possible)
- Complete argument on one page

### Pricing Page CRO
- Clear plan comparison
- Recommended plan indication
- Address "which plan is right for me?" anxiety

### Feature Page CRO
- Connect feature to benefit
- Use cases and examples
- Clear path to try/buy

### Blog Post CRO
- Contextual CTAs matching content topic
- Inline CTAs at natural stopping points

## Experiment Ideas

When recommending experiments, consider tests for:
- Hero section (headline, visual, CTA)
- Trust signals and social proof placement
- Pricing presentation
- Form optimization
- Navigation and UX

**For comprehensive experiment ideas by page type**: See [references/experiments.md](references/experiments.md)

---

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What's your current conversion rate and goal?
2. Where is traffic coming from?
3. What does your signup/purchase flow look like after this page?
4. Do you have user research, heatmaps, or session recordings?
5. What have you already tried?

## Form Optimization

When enrichment controls the next step after a lead form, use the [revops inbound-routing playbook](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills/blob/main/skills/revops/references/inbound-routing.md): preserve valid submissions, bound the lookup wait, and provide a useful fallback when qualification is unknown.

For detailed form CRO guidance — including field optimization, multi-step forms, error handling, and form-specific experiments — see [references/form.md](references/form.md).
